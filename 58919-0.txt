_HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY._

=THE NORMAN PEOPLE=, AND THEIR EXISTING DESCENDANTS IN THE BRITISH
DOMINIONS AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. One handsome vol. 8vo. Price
21s. [_In the Press._

    This work is the result of many years of research into the
    history of the Norman race in England. It is generally supposed
    to have become extinct; but careful study has shown that it
    exists and forms a large part of the English people. In the
    course of the work the early history of the whole aristocracy
    is revised, reconstructed, and very many thousands of families
    are shown to be Norman which have never before been accounted
    for.

=A MEMOIR OF THE LATE REVEREND DR. ROWLAND WILLIAMS=, With selections
from his Note-books and Correspondence. Edited by =Mrs. Rowland
Williams=. With a Photographic Portrait. [_In the Press._

present time, of the Geography and History of Central Asia. By =Baron F.
Von Hellwald=, Member of the Geographical Societies of Paris, Geneva,
Vienna, &c., &c. Translated by =Lieut.-Col. Theodore Wirgman, LL.B.=,

=BOKHARA: ITS HISTORY AND CONQUEST.= By =Professor Arminius Vàmbèry=, of
the University of Pesth, Author of “Travels in Central Asia,” &c. Demy
8vo. Price 18s.

    “We conclude with a cordial recommendation of this valuable
    book. In the present work his moderation, scholarship, insight,
    and occasionally very impressive style, have raised him to the
    dignity of an historian”—_Saturday Review._

    “Almost every page abounds with composition of peculiar
    merit, as well as with an account of some thrilling event
    more exciting than any to be found in an ordinary work of
    fiction.”—_Morning Post._

=THE RELIGIOUS HISTORY OF IRELAND=: PRIMITIVE, PAPAL, AND PROTESTANT;
including the Evangelical Missions, Catholic Agitations, and Church
Progress of the last half century. By =James Godkin=, Author of “Ireland,
her Churches,” &c. 1 vol. 8vo. Price 12s.

    “For those who shun blue books, and yet desire some of the
    information they contain, these latter chapters on the
    statistics of the various religious denominations will be
    welcomed.”—_Evening Standard._

    “Mr. Godkin writes with evident honesty, and the topic on
    which he writes is one about which an honest book is greatly
    wanted.”—_Examiner._

=’ILÂM ĔN NÂS.= Historical Tales and Anecdotes of the Times of the Early
Khalifahs. Translated from the Arabic Originals. By =Mrs. Godfrey Clerk=,
Author of “The Antipodes and Round the World.” Crown 8vo. Price 7s.

    “But there is a high tone about them, a love of justice, of
    truth and integrity, a sense of honour and manliness, and a
    simple devotion to religious duty, which however mistaken
    according to our lights, is deserving of every respect. The
    translation is the work of a lady, and a very excellent and
    scholar-like translation it is, clearly and pleasantly written,
    and illustrated and explained by copious notes, indicating
    considerable learning and research.”—_Saturday Review._

    “Those who like stories full of the genuine colour and
    fragrance of the East, should by all means read Mrs. Godfrey
    Clerk’s volume.”—_Spectator._

    “As full of valuable information as it is of amusing
    incident.”—_Evening Standard._

Jeanne d’Arc,” “In the Silver Age,” &c. Crown 8vo. 8s. 6d.

    “A graceful and touching, as well as truthful account of the
    Franco-Prussian War. Those who are in the habit of reading
    books to children will find this at once instructive and
    delightful.”—_Public Opinion._

    “Miss Parr has the great gift of charming simplicity of style;
    and if children are not interested in her book, many of their
    seniors will be.”—_British Quarterly Review._

=ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE.= Correspondence and Conversations with NASSAU W.
SENIOR from 1833 to 1859. Edited by =Mrs. M. C. M. Simpson=. In 2 vols.,
large post 8vo. 21s.

    “Another of those interesting journals in which Mr. Senior has,
    as it were, crystallized the sayings of some of those many
    remarkable men with whom he came in contact.”—_Morning Post._

    “A book replete with knowledge and thought.”—_Quarterly Review._

    “An extremely interesting book.”—_Saturday Review._

=JOURNALS KEPT IN FRANCE AND ITALY.= From 1848 to 1852. With a Sketch of
the Revolution of 1848. By the late =Nassau William Senior=. Edited by
his Daughter, =M. C. M. Simpson=. In 2 vols., post 8vo. 24s.

    “The book has a genuine historical value.”—_Saturday Review._

    “The present volume gives us conversations with some
    of the most prominent men in the political history of
    France and Italy.... Mr. Senior has the art of inspiring
    all men with frankness, and of persuading them to put
    themselves unreservedly in his hands without fear of private
    circulation.”—_Athenæum._

    “No better, more honest, and more readable view of the state of
    political society during the existence of the second Republic
    could well be looked for.”—_Examiner._

    attaches to biography.”—_Scotsman._

    “A graceful contribution to the lighter record of
    history.”—_English Churchman._

    “No author could have stated the case more temperately than
    he has done, and few could have placed before the reader so
    graphically the story which had to be told.”—_Leeds Mercury._

=SARA COLERIDGE, MEMOIR AND LETTERS OF.= Edited by her =Daughters=. 2
vols. Crown 8vo. With 2 Portraits. Price 24s. Second Edition, Revised and
Corrected.

    “We have read these two volumes with genuine
    gratification.”—_Hour._

    “We could have wished to give specimens of her very just,
    subtle, and concise criticisms on authors of every sort and
    time—poets, moralists, historians, and philosophers. Sara
    Coleridge, as she is revealed, or rather reveals herself, in
    the correspondence, makes a brilliant addition to a brilliant
    family reputation.”—_Saturday Review._

    “These charming volumes are attractive in two ways: first, as a
    memorial of a most amiable woman of high intellectual mark; and
    secondly, as rekindling recollections, and adding a little to
    our information regarding the life of Sara Coleridge’s father,
    the poet and philosopher.”—_Athenæum._

    “An acceptable record, and present an adequate image of a mind
    of singular beauty and no inconsiderable power.”—_Examiner._

Princess. Medium 8vo. 12s. 6d.

    history.”—_Spectator._

this country. By =H. A. Page=. Large post 8vo. 7s. 6d.

    “The Memoir is followed by a criticism of Hawthorne as a
    writer; and the criticism is, on the whole, very well written,
    and exhibits a discriminating enthusiasm for one of the most
    fascinating of novelists.”—_Saturday Review._

    “Seldom has it been our lot to meet with a more
    appreciative delineation of character than this Memoir of
    Hawthorne.”—_Morning Post._

    or as the life of a great Englishman.”—_Spectator._

=CABINET PORTRAITS.= BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF LIVING STATESMEN. By =T.
Wemyss Reid=. 1 vol. crown 8vo. 7s. 6d.

    Several chapters devoted to the characteristics of the people
    are exceedingly interesting and remarkable.... The whole book
    deserves the heartiest commendation ... sparkling and amusing
    from beginning to end. Reading it is like rambling about with
    a companion who is content to loiter, observing everything,
    commenting upon everything, turning everything into a picture,
    with a cheerful flow of spirits, full of fun, but far above
    frivolity.”—_Spectator._

    “He writes very lightly and pleasantly, and brightens his pages
    with a good deal of humour. His experiences were varied enough,
    and his book contains a series of vivid and miscellaneous
    sketches. We can recommend his whole volume as very amusing
    reading.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    book is prevented from degenerating into a mere scientific
    catalogue by many graphic sketches of the rambles.”—_John Bull._

    “To the naturalist the book will be most valuable.... To the
    general reader the book will prove most interesting, for the
    style is pleasant and chatty, and the information given is
    so graphic and full, that those who care nothing for natural
    history as a pursuit will yet read these descriptions with
    great interest.”—_Evening Standard._

    “Both sportsmen and naturalists will find this work replete

of the Country showing Routes. Price 21s.

    “If any of our readers think of scraping an acquaintance
    with Norway, let them read this book. The gypsies, always an
    interesting study, become doubly interesting, when we are, as
    in these pages, introduced to them in their daily walk and
    conversation.”—_Examiner._

    “Written in a very lively style, and has throughout a smack of
    dry humour and satiric reflection which shows the writer to be
    a keen observer of men and things. We hope that many will read
    it and find in it the same amusement as ourselves.”—_Times._

    illustrated.”—_Standard._

    of a summer cruise among the wild sports and fantastic

    Exploration.”—_Graphic._

    “A careful and instructive book. Full of facts, full of
    information, and full of interest.”—_Literary Churchman._

DOUBT, OR DISTRESS. By =Manley Hopkins=, Author of “A Handbook of

    “Combines in quite a marvellous manner a fullness of
    information which will make it perfectly indispensable in the
    captain’s bookcase, and equally suitable to the gentleman’s
    library. This synopsis of the law of shipping in all its
    multifarious ramifications and the hints he gives on a variety
    of topics must be invaluable to the master mariner whenever
    he is in doubt, difficulty, and danger.”—_Mercantile Marine
    Magazine._

    “A truly excellent contribution to the literature of our marine
    commerce.”—_Echo._

    “Those immediately concerned will find it well worth while to

=LOMBARD STREET.= A Description of the Money Market. By =Walter Bagehot=.
Large crown 8vo. Third Edition. 7s. 6d.

    “An acceptable addition to the literature of finance.”—_Stock
    Exchange Review._

    “Mr. Bagehot touches incidentally a hundred points connected
    with his subject, and pours serene white light upon them
    all.”—_Spectator._

    “Anybody who wishes to have a clear idea of the workings of
    what is called the Money Market should procure a little volume
    which Mr. Bagehot has just published, and he will there find
    the whole thing in a nut-shell.... The subject is one, it is
    almost needless to say, on which Mr. Bagehot writes with the
    authority of a man who combines practical experience with
    scientific study.”—_Saturday Review._

    “Besides its main topic, the management of the reserve of the
    Bank of England, it is full of the most interesting economic
    history.”—_Athenæum._

    “Open the book, however, at what page the reader may, he will

with Notes and a Supplement, by =Joseph Payne, F.C.P.=, Author of
“Lectures on the Science and Art of Education,” &c. Crown 8vo. 2s. 6d.

    “This study, according to her just notions on the subject, is
    to be fundamentally based on the exercise of the pupil’s own
    powers of observation. He is to see and examine the properties
    of plants and flowers at first hand, not merely to be informed
    of what others have seen and examined.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    unknown territories.”—_Daily News._

    “This is one of the best books to while away an hour and
    cause a generous laugh that we have come across for a long
    time.”—_John Bull._

=THE SECRET OF LONG LIFE.= Dedicated by Special Permission to Lord St.
Leonards. Third Edition. Large crown 8vo. 5s.

    Quarterly Review._

    “Entitled to the warmest admiration.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    varied entertainment which it affords.”—_Daily News._

events. Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d.

    “A pleasing and clever study on the department of higher
    politics.”—_Guardian._

    “No writer before him had set out so clearly what the efficient
    part of the English Constitution really is.”—_Pall Mall
    Gazette._

    “Clear and practical.”—_Globe._

=REPUBLICAN SUPERSTITIONS.= Illustrated by the Political History of
the United States. Including a Correspondence with M. Louis Blanc. By
=Moncure D. Conway=. Crown 8vo. 5s.

    “A very able exposure of the most plausible fallacies of
    Republicanism, by a writer of remarkable vigour and purity of
    style.”—_Standard._

    “Mr. Conway writes with ardent sincerity. He gives us some good
    anecdotes, and he is occasionally almost eloquent.”—_Guardian_,
    July 2, 1873.

=STREAMS FROM HIDDEN SOURCES.= By =B. Montgomerie Ranking=. Crown 8vo. 6s.

    “In point of style it is well executed, and the prefatory
    notices are very good.”—_Spectator._

    “The effect of reading the seven tales he presents to us is to
    make us wish for some seven more of the same kind.”—_Pall Mall
    Gazette._

    “The tales are given throughout in the quaint version of the
    earliest English translators, and in the introduction to each
    will be found much curious information as to their origin, and
    the fate which they have met at the hands of later transcribers
    or imitators, and much tasteful appreciation of the varied
    sources from whence they are extracted.... We doubt not that
    Mr. Ranking’s enthusiasm will communicate itself to many of his
    readers, and induce them in like manner to follow back these
    streamlets to their parent river.”—_Graphic._




_MILITARY WORKS._


=THE GERMAN ARTILLERY IN THE BATTLES NEAR METZ.= Based on the official
reports of the German Artillery. By =Captain Hoffbauer=, Instructor in
the German Artillery and Engineer School. Translated by =Capt. E. O.
Hollist=.

    This history gives a detailed account of the movements of the
    German artillery in the three days’ fighting to the east and
    west of Metz, which resulted in paralyzing the army under
    Marshal Bazaine, and its subsequent surrender. The action of
    the batteries with reference to the other arms is clearly
    explained, and the valuable maps show the positions taken up
    by the individual batteries at each stage of the contests.
    Tables are also supplied in the Appendix, furnishing full
    details as to the number of killed and wounded, expenditure of
    ammunition, &c. The campaign of 1870-71 having demonstrated the
    importance of artillery to an extent which has not previously
    been conceded to it, this work forms a valuable part of the
    literature of the campaign, and will be read with interest
    not only by members of the regular but also by those of the
    auxiliary forces.

    “A delightful military classic, and what is more, a most useful
    one. The young officer should have it always at hand to open
    anywhere and read a bit, and we warrant him that let that
    bit be ever so small it will give him material for an hour’s
    thinking.”—_United Service Gazette._

=THE FRONTAL ATTACK OF INFANTRY.= By =Capt. Laymann=, Instructor of
Tactics at the Military College, Neisse. Translated by =Colonel Edward

=THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIRST ARMY IN NORTHERN FRANCE AGAINST FAIDHERBE.=
By =Colonel Count Hermann Von Wartensleben=, Chief of the Staff of the
First Army. Translated by =Colonel C. H. Von Wright=. In demy 8vo.
Uniform with the above. Price 9s.

    “Very clear, simple, yet eminently instructive, is this
    history. It is not overladen with useless details, is written
    in good taste, and possesses the inestimable value of being in
    great measure the record of operations actually witnessed by
    the author, supplemented by official documents.”—_Athenæum._

    “The work is based on the official war documents—it is
    especially valuable—the narrative is remarkably vivid and
    interesting. Two well-executed maps enable the reader to trace
    out the scenes of General Manteuffel’s operations.”—_Naval and
    Military Gazette._

=STUDIES IN THE NEW INFANTRY TACTICS.= Parts I. & II. By =Major W. Von
Schereff=. Translated from the German by =Col. Lumley Graham=. Price 7s.
6d.

    “Major Von Schereff’s ‘Studies in Tactics’ is worthy of the
    perusal—indeed, of the thoughtful study—of every military
    man. The subject of the respective advantages of attack and
    defence, and of the methods in which each form of battle should
    be carried out under the fire of modern arms, is exhaustively
    and admirably treated; indeed, we cannot but consider it to be
    decidedly superior to any work which has hitherto appeared in
    English upon this all-important subject.”—_Standard._

=TACTICAL DEDUCTIONS FROM THE WAR OF 1870-1.= By =Captain A. Von
Boguslawski=. Translated by =Colonel Lumley Graham=, late 18th (Royal
Irish) Regiment. Demy 8vo. Uniform with the above. Price 7s.

    “Major Boguslawski’s tactical deductions from the war are,
    that infantry still preserve their superiority over cavalry,
    that open order must henceforth be the main principles of all
    drill, and that the chassepot is the best of all small arms
    for precision.... We must, without delay, impress brain and
    forethought into the British Service; and we cannot commence
    the good work too soon, or better, than by placing the two
    books (‘The Operations of the German Armies’ and ‘Tactical
    Deductions’) we have here criticised, in every military
    library, and introducing them as class-books in every tactical
    school.”—_United Service Gazette._

=THE ARMY OF THE NORTH-GERMAN CONFEDERATION.= A Brief Description of its
Organisation, of the different Branches of the Service and their ‘Rôle’
in War, of its Mode of Fighting, &c. By a =Prussian General=. Translated
from the German by =Col. Edward Newdigate=. Demy 8vo. 5s.

    ⁂ The authorship of this book was erroneously ascribed to the
    renowned General von Moltke, but there can be little doubt that
    it was written under his immediate inspiration.

=THE OPERATIONS OF THE GERMAN ARMIES IN FRANCE, FROM SEDAN TO THE END OF
THE WAR OF 1870-1.= With Large Official Map. From the Journals of the
Head-quarters Staff, by =Major Wm. Blume=. Translated by =E. M. Jones=,
Major 20th Foot, late Professor of Military History, Sandhurst. Demy 8vo.
Price 9s.

    “The book is of absolute necessity to the military student....
    The work is one of high merit.”—_United Service Gazette._

    “The work of translation has been well done. In notes,
    prefaces, and introductions, much additional information has
    been given.”—_Athenæum._

    “The work of Major von Blume in its English dress forms the
    most valuable addition to our stock of works upon the war
    that our press has put forth. Major Blume writes with a clear
    conciseness much wanting in many of his country’s historians.
    Our space forbids our doing more than commending it earnestly
    as the most authentic and instructive narrative of the second
    section of the war that has yet appeared.”—_Saturday Review._

=THE OPERATIONS OF THE SOUTH ARMY IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY, 1871.=
Compiled from the Official War Documents of the Head-quarters of the
Southern Army. By =Count Hermann Von Wartensleben=, Colonel in the
Prussian General Staff. Translated by =Colonel C. H. Von Wright=. Demy
8vo, with Maps. Uniform with the above. Price 6s.

=HASTY INTRENCHMENTS.= By =Colonel A. Brialmont=. Translated by
=Lieutenant Charles A. Empson, R.A.= Demy 8vo. Nine Plates. Price 6s.

    “A valuable contribution to military literature.”—_Athenæum._

    “In seven short chapters it gives plain directions for forming
    shelter-trenches, with the best method of carrying the
    necessary tools, and it offers practical illustrations of the
    use of hasty intrenchments on the field of battle.”—_United
    Service Magazine._

    “It supplies that which our own textbooks give but imperfectly,
    viz., hints as to how a position can best be strengthened by
    means ... of such extemporised intrenchments and batteries as
    can be thrown up by infantry in the space of four or five hours
    ... deserves to become a standard military work.”—_Standard._

    “Clearly and critically written.”—_Wellington Gazette._

=STUDIES IN LEADING TROOPS.= By =Colonel Von Verdy Du Vernois=. An
authorised and accurate Translation by =Lieutenant H. J. T. Hildyard=,
71st Foot. Parts I. and II. Demy 8vo. Price 7s.

    ⁂ General BEAUCHAMP WALKER says of this work:—“I recommend
    the first two numbers of Colonel von Verdy’s ‘Studies’ to the
    attentive perusal of my brother officers. They supply a want
    which I have often felt during my service in this country,
    namely, a minuter tactical detail of the minor operations of
    the war than any but the most observant and fortunately-placed
    staff-officer is in a position to give. I have read and re-read
    them very carefully, I hope with profit, certainly with great
    interest, and believe that practice, in the sense of these
    ‘Studies,’ would be a valuable preparation for manœuvres on a
    more extended scale.”—Berlin, June, 1872.

    ⁂ This is the text-book of instruction in the German cavalry,
    and comprises all the details connected with the military
    duties of cavalry soldiers on service. The translation is made
    from a new edition, which contains the modifications introduced
    consequent on the experiences of the late war. The great
    interest that students feel in all the German military methods,
    will, it is believed, render this book especially acceptable at
    the present time.

    EXTRACT FROM PROSPECTUS.

    The Editor has undertaken to frame for India,—what he has been
    eminently successful in doing for England and her colonies,—a
    series of educational works, which he hopes will prove as
    suitable for the peculiar wants of the country as they will be
    consistent with the leading idea above alluded to. Like all
    beginnings, his present instalments are necessarily somewhat
    meagre and elementary; but he only awaits official and public
    approval to complete, within a comparatively brief period,
    his contemplated plan of a specific and fairly comprehensive
    series of works in the various leading vernaculars of the
    Indian continent. Meanwhile, those on his general catalogue
    may be found suitable, in their present form, for use in the
    Anglo-vernacular and English schools of India.

_The following Works are now ready_:—

    “The author of these verses has written a very touching story
    of the human heart in the story he tells with such pathos and
    power, of an affection cherished so long and so secretly.... It
    is not the least merit of these pages that they are everywhere
    illumined with moral and religious sentiment suggested, not
    paraded, of the brightest, purest character.”—_Standard._

=CALDERON’S DRAMAS.=

    “Genuine power displayed.”—_Examiner._

    “ ... Poetical feeling is manifest here, and the diction of the
    poem is unimpeachable.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    “He has successfully attempted what has seldom before been
    well done, viz., the treatment of subjects not in themselves
    poetical from a poetic point of view.”—_Graphic._

    a downrightness of expression which does not shrink from even
    slang if it seem best fitted for his purpose.”—_Illustrated

    to meet with such a ballad as ‘May Margaret’ in the present
    volume.”—_Westminster Review._

=ASPROMONTE, AND OTHER POEMS.= Second Edition, cloth. 4s. 6d.

    “The volume is anonymous, but there is no reason for the
    author to be ashamed of it. The ‘Poems of Italy’ are evidently
    inspired by genuine enthusiasm in the cause espoused; and
    one of them, ‘The Execution of Felice Orsini,’ has much
    poetic merit, the event celebrated being told with dramatic
    force.”—_Athenæum._

    beautiful in expression, and often subtle in thought.”—_Pall
    Mall Gazette._

    “The dominant charm of all these sonnets is the pervading
    presence of the writer’s personality, never obtruded but always
    impalpably diffused. The light of a devout, gentle, and kindly
    spirit, a delicate and graceful fancy, a keen intelligence
    irradiates these thoughts.”—_Contemporary Review._

=GOETHE’S FAUST.= A New Translation in Rime. By the =Rev. C. Kegan Paul=.
Crown 8vo. 6s.

    “His translation is the most minutely accurate that has yet
    been produced....”—_Examiner._

    as well suited to convey its meaning to English readers as any
    we have yet seen.”—_Edinburgh Daily Review._

    “Mr. Paul is a zealous and a faithful interpreter.”—_Saturday
    Review._

    “These poems will assuredly take high rank among the class to
    which they belong.”—_British Quarterly Review, April 1st._

    “If these poems are the mere preludes of a mind growing in
    power and in inclination for verse, we have in them the promise
    of a fine poet.”—_Spectator, February 17th._

    “No extracts could do justice to the exquisite tones, the
    felicitous phrasing and delicately wrought harmonies of some of
    these poems.”—_Nonconformist, March 27th._

    “It has a purity and delicacy of feeling like morning
    air.”—_Graphic, March 16th._

=THE LEGENDS OF ST. PATRICK AND OTHER POEMS.= By =Aubrey de Vere=. Crown
8vo. 5s.

    “Mr. De Vere’s versification in his earlier poems is
    characterised by great sweetness and simplicity. He is master
    of his instrument, and rarely offends the ear with false notes.
    Poems such as these scarcely admit of quotation, for their
    charm is not, and ought not to be, found in isolated passages;
    but we can promise the patient and thoughtful reader much
    pleasure in the perusal of this volume.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    “We have marked, in almost every page, excellent touches from
    which we know not how to select. We have but space to commend
    the varied structure of his verse, the carefulness of his
    grammar, and his excellent English.”—_Saturday Review._

    “ ... A very lively and agreeable novel.”—_Vanity Fair._

    “‘The Queen’s Shilling’ is a capital story, far more
    interesting than the meagre sketch we have given of the
    fortunes of the hero and heroine can suggest. Every scene,
    character, and incident of the book are so life-like that they
    seem drawn from life direct.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    characteristic....”—_Athenæum._

    honourable mention to Mr. Collins’s ‘vers de société,’ the
    writing of which has almost become a lost art.”—_Pall Mall
    Gazette._

    “A bright, fresh, and original book.”—_Standard._

    fiction.”—_Morning Advertiser._

=BRESSANT.= A Romance. By =Julian Hawthorne=. 2 vols. Crown 8vo.

    story as it stands is one of the most powerful with which we
    are acquainted.”—_Times._

    “Pretty certain of meeting in this country a grateful and
    appreciative reception.”—_Athenæum._

    “Mr. Julian Hawthorne is endowed with a large share of his
    father’s peculiar genius.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    “Enough to make us hopeful that we shall once more have
    reason to rejoice whenever we hear that a new work is
    coming out written by one who bears the honoured name of
    Hawthorne.”—_Saturday Review._

    “The novel as a whole is a remarkable one, because it is
    uncompromisingly true to life.”—_Daily News._

=SEETA.= By =Colonel Meadows Taylor=, Author of “Tara,” “Ralph Darnell,”
&c. Crown 8vo. 3 vols.

    “The story is well told, native life is admirably
    described, and the petty intrigues of native rulers, and
    their hatred of the English, mingled with fear lest the
    latter should eventually prove the victors, are cleverly
    depicted.”—_Athenæum._

    “We cannot speak too highly of Colonel Meadows Taylor’s
    book.... We would recommend all novel-readers to purchase it at
    the earliest opportunity.”—_John Bull._

    “Thoroughly interesting and enjoyable reading.”—_Examiner._

=HESTER MORLEY’S PROMISE.= By =Hesba Stretton=. 3 vols.

    “‘Hester Morley’s Promise’ is much better than the average
    novel of the day; it has much more claim to critical
    consideration as a piece of literary work,—not mere
    mechanism. The pictures of a narrow society—narrow of
    soul and intellect—in which the book abounds, are very
    clever.”—_Spectator._

    “Its charm lies not so much, perhaps, in any special
    excellence in character, drawing, or construction—though all
    the characters stand out clearly and are well sustained, and
    the interest of the story never flags—as in general tone and
    colouring.”—_Observer._

=THE DOCTOR’S DILEMMA.= By =Hesba Stretton=, Author of “Little Meg,” &c.,
&c. Crown 8vo. 3 vols.

    “A fascinating story which scarcely flags in interest from the

    Gazette_, June 28, 1873.

    “Some interesting letters are introduced, amongst others,
    several from the late King William IV.”—_Spectator._

    “Well and pleasantly told. There are also some capital
    descriptions of English country life in the last century,
    presenting a vivid picture of England before the introduction
    of railways, and the busy life accompanying them.”—_Evening
    Standard._

=JOHANNES OLAF.= By =E. de Wille=. Translated by =F. E. Bunnett=. Crown
8vo. 3 vols.

    “The art of description is fully exhibited; perception of
    character and capacity for delineating it are obvious; while
    there is great breadth and comprehensiveness in the plan of the
    story.”—_Morning Post._

=THE SPINSTERS OF BLATCHINGTON.= By =Mar. Travers=. 2 vols. Crown 8vo.

8vo.

    “A finished and delicate cabinet picture, no line is
    without its purpose, but all contribute to the unity of the
    work.”—_Athenæum._

    “For the delicacies of character-drawing, for play of incident,
    and for finish of style, we must refer our readers to the story
    itself.”—_Daily News._

    “This undeniably pleasing story.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

=VANESSA.= By the Author of “Thomasina.” 2 vols. Crown 8vo. [_Shortly._

=THE STORY OF SIR EDWARD’S WIFE.= By =Hamilton Marshall=, Author of “For

    can tell a story closely and pleasantly.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._

    “There is a quaintness and simplicity in the roguery of the
    hero that makes his life as attractive as that of Guzman
    d’Alfarache or Gil Blas, and so we advise our readers not to
    be dismayed at the length of Pandurang Hari, but to read it
    resolutely through. If they do this they cannot, we think, fail
    to be both amused and interested.”—_Times._

    “Reads like a tale of life, with all its incidents. The
    young will take to it for its love portions, the older

    philosophy.”—_Athenæum._

    “There is a positive fragrance as of newly-mown hay about it,

    “A singularly calm, thoughtful, and philosophical inquiry into
    what Truth is, and what its authority.”—_Leeds Mercury._

    “It tells the world what it does not like to hear, but what
    it cannot be told too often, that Truth is something stronger
    and more enduring than our little doings, and speakings, and
    actings.”—_Literary Churchman._

    attention and give him a desire to know more of the teachings
    of this worthy follower of the saintly St. Dominick.”—_Morning
    Post._

    “The book is worth studying as an evidence of the way in which
    an able man may be crippled by theological chains.”—_Examiner._

    eloquent.”—_Public Opinion._

    “Mr. Drew has invented a new method of illustrating Scripture
    history—from observation of the countries. Instead of narrating
    his travels, and referring from time to time to the facts
    of sacred history belonging to the different countries, he
    writes an outline history of the Hebrew nation from Abraham
    downwards, with special reference to the various points in
    which the geography illustrates the history.... He is very
    successful in picturing to his readers the scenes before his
    own mind.”—_Saturday Review._

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
