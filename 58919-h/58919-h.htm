<p><b>THE NORMAN PEOPLE</b>, <span class="smcap">And their existing descendants in the
British Dominions and the United States of America</span>. One
handsome vol. 8vo. Price 21s. <span class="spacer">[<i>In the Press.</i></span></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This work is the result of many years
of research into the history of the Norman
race in England. It is generally supposed
to have become extinct; but careful study
has shown that it exists and forms a large
part of the English people. In the course
of the work the early history of the whole
aristocracy is revised, reconstructed, and
very many thousands of families are shown
to be Norman which have never before
been accounted for.</p>

insight, and occasionally very impressive
style, have raised him to the dignity of
an historian”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“Almost every page abounds with composition
of peculiar merit, as well as with an
account of some thrilling event more exciting
than any to be found in an ordinary
work of fiction.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

Price 7s.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“But there is a high tone about them,
a love of justice, of truth and integrity,
a sense of honour and manliness, and a
simple devotion to religious duty, which
however mistaken according to our lights,
is deserving of every respect. The
translation is the work of a lady, and a
very excellent and scholar-like translation
it is, clearly and pleasantly written, and
illustrated and explained by copious notes,
indicating considerable learning and research.”—<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>“Those who like stories full of the
genuine colour and fragrance of the East,

truthful account of the Franco-Prussian
War. Those who are in the habit of reading
books to children will find this at
once instructive and delightful.”—<i>Public
Opinion.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Parr has the great gift of charming
simplicity of style; and if children are
not interested in her book, many of their
seniors will be.”—<i>British Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The book has a genuine historical
value.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“The present volume gives us conversations

all men with frankness, and of persuading
them to put themselves unreservedly in
his hands without fear of private circulation.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“No better, more honest, and more readable
view of the state of political society
during the existence of the second Republic

more temperately than he has done, and

graphically the story which had to be told.”—<i>Leeds

genuine gratification.”—<i>Hour.</i></p>

of her very just, subtle, and concise
criticisms on authors of every sort and time—poets,
moralists, historians, and philosophers.
Sara Coleridge, as she is revealed,
or rather reveals herself, in the correspondence,
makes a brilliant addition to
a brilliant family reputation.”—<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>“These charming volumes are attractive
in two ways: first, as a memorial of a most
amiable woman of high intellectual mark;
and secondly, as rekindling recollections,
and adding a little to our information regarding
the life of Sara Coleridge’s father,
the poet and philosopher.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

adequate image of a mind of singular
beauty and no inconsiderable power.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

devoted to the characteristics of the people
are exceedingly interesting and remarkable....
The whole book deserves the heartiest
commendation ... sparkling and amusing
from beginning to end. Reading it is like
rambling about with a companion who is
content to loiter, observing everything,
commenting upon everything, turning
everything into a picture, with a cheerful
flow of spirits, full of fun, but far above
frivolity.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“He writes very lightly and pleasantly,

interest, while the book is prevented from
degenerating into a mere scientific catalogue
by many graphic sketches of the
rambles.”—<i>John Bull.</i></p>

<p>“To the naturalist the book will be most
valuable.... To the general reader the
book will prove most interesting, for the
style is pleasant and chatty, and the information
given is so graphic and full, that
those who care nothing for natural history
as a pursuit will yet read these descriptions
with great interest.”—<i>Evening Standard.</i></p>

<p>“Both sportsmen and naturalists will
find this work replete with anecdote and
carefully-recorded observation, which will
entertain them.”—<i>Nature.</i></p>

to them in their daily walk and
conversation.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“Written in a very lively style, and has
throughout a smack of dry humour and
satiric reflection which shows the writer to
be a keen observer of men and things. We
hope that many will read it and find in it
the same amusement as ourselves.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p><b>THE GERMAN ARTILLERY IN THE BATTLES NEAR METZ.</b>
Based on the official reports of the German Artillery. By <b>Captain
Hoffbauer</b>, Instructor in the German Artillery and Engineer School.
Translated by <b>Capt. E. O. Hollist</b>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This history gives a detailed account of
the movements of the German artillery in
the three days’ fighting to the east and
west of Metz, which resulted in paralyzing
the army under Marshal Bazaine, and its
subsequent surrender. The action of the
batteries with reference to the other arms
is clearly explained, and the valuable maps
show the positions taken up by the individual
batteries at each stage of the contests.
Tables are also supplied in the
Appendix, furnishing full details as to the
number of killed and wounded, expenditure
of ammunition, &amp;c. The campaign
of 1870-71 having demonstrated the importance
of artillery to an extent which

By <b>Major W. Von Schereff</b>. Translated from the German by <b>Col.
Lumley Graham</b>. Price 7s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Major Von Schereff’s ‘Studies in Tactics’
is worthy of the perusal—indeed, of
the thoughtful study—of every military
man. The subject of the respective advantages
of attack and defence, and of the
methods in which each form of battle
should be carried out under the fire of
modern arms, is exhaustively and admirably
treated; indeed, we cannot but consider
it to be decidedly superior to any
work which has hitherto appeared in English
upon this all-important subject.”—<i>Standard.</i></p>

the above. Price 7s.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Major Boguslawski’s tactical deductions
from the war are, that infantry still
preserve their superiority over cavalry,
that open order must henceforth be the
main principles of all drill, and that the
chassepot is the best of all small arms for
precision.... We must, without delay,
impress brain and forethought into the
British Service; and we cannot commence
the good work too soon, or better, than by
placing the two books (‘The Operations of
the German Armies’ and ‘Tactical Deductions’)
we have here criticised, in every
military library, and introducing them as
class-books in every tactical school.”—<i>United

of the use of hasty intrenchments on the field
of battle.”—<i>United Service Magazine.</i></p>

<p>“It supplies that which our own textbooks
give but imperfectly, viz., hints as
to how a position can best be strengthened
by means ... of such extemporised intrenchments
and batteries as can be thrown
up by infantry in the space of four or five

<p>⁂ General <span class="smcap">Beauchamp Walker</span> says
of this work:—“I recommend the first
two numbers of Colonel von Verdy’s
‘Studies’ to the attentive perusal of my
brother officers. They supply a want
which I have often felt during my service
in this country, namely, a minuter tactical
detail of the minor operations of the war
than any but the most observant and fortunately-placed
staff-officer is in a position
to give. I have read and re-read them
very carefully, I hope with profit, certainly
with great interest, and believe that practice,
in the sense of these ‘Studies,’ would
be a valuable preparation for manœuvres
on a more extended scale.”—Berlin, June,

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Extract from Prospectus.</span></p>

<p>The Editor has undertaken to frame for
India,—what he has been eminently successful
in doing for England and her
colonies,—a series of educational works,
which he hopes will prove as suitable for
the peculiar wants of the country as they
will be consistent with the leading idea
above alluded to. Like all beginnings, his
present instalments are necessarily somewhat
meagre and elementary; but he only
awaits official and public approval to complete,
within a comparatively brief period,
his contemplated plan of a specific and
fairly comprehensive series of works in the
various leading vernaculars of the Indian
continent. Meanwhile, those on his general
catalogue may be found suitable, in their
present form, for use in the Anglo-vernacular
and English schools of India.</p>

<p>“Genuine power displayed.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“ ... Poetical feeling is manifest
here, and the diction of the poem is unimpeachable.”—<i>Pall

has seldom before been well done, viz., the
treatment of subjects not in themselves
poetical from a poetic point of view.”—<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>“The volume is anonymous, but there
is no reason for the author to be ashamed
of it. The ‘Poems of Italy’ are evidently
inspired by genuine enthusiasm in the
cause espoused; and one of them, ‘The
Execution of Felice Orsini,’ has much
poetic merit, the event celebrated being
told with dramatic force.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Turner is a genuine poet; his song
is sweet and pure, beautiful in expression,
and often subtle in thought.”—<i>Pall Mall

<p>“The dominant charm of all these sonnets
is the pervading presence of the writer’s
personality, never obtruded but always
impalpably diffused. The light of a devout,
gentle, and kindly spirit, a delicate and
graceful fancy, a keen intelligence irradiates
these thoughts.”—<i>Contemporary Review.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Mr. De Vere’s versification in his
earlier poems is characterised by great
sweetness and simplicity. He is master of
his instrument, and rarely offends the ear
with false notes. Poems such as these
scarcely admit of quotation, for their charm
is not, and ought not to be, found in isolated
passages; but we can promise the patient
and thoughtful reader much pleasure in the
perusal of this volume.”—<i>Pall Mall

<p>“We have marked, in almost every
page, excellent touches from which we
know not how to select. We have but

his verse, the carefulness of his grammar,
and his excellent English.”—<i>Saturday

better than the average novel of the day;
it has much more claim to critical consideration
as a piece of literary work,—not
mere mechanism. The pictures of a narrow
society—narrow of soul and intellect—in
which the book abounds, are very clever.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“Its charm lies not so much, perhaps, in
any special excellence in character, drawing,
or construction—though all the characters
stand out clearly and are well
sustained, and the interest of the story
never flags—as in general tone and colouring.”—<i>Observer.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
