<p><b>THE NORMAN PEOPLE</b>, <span class="smcap">And their existing descendants in the
British Dominions and the United States of America</span>. One
handsome vol. 8vo. Price 21s. <span class="spacer">[<i>In the Press.</i></span></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This work is the result of many years
of research into the history of the Norman
race in England. It is generally supposed
to have become extinct; but careful study
has shown that it exists and forms a large
part of the English people. In the course
of the work the early history of the whole
aristocracy is revised, reconstructed, and
very many thousands of families are shown
to be Norman which have never before
been accounted for.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“We conclude with a cordial recommendation

an historian”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

of peculiar merit, as well as with an
account of some thrilling event more exciting
than any to be found in an ordinary
work of fiction.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

about which an honest book is greatly
wanted.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

Clerk</b>, Author of “The Antipodes and Round the World.” Crown 8vo.
Price 7s.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“But there is a high tone about them,
a love of justice, of truth and integrity,
a sense of honour and manliness, and a
simple devotion to religious duty, which
however mistaken according to our lights,
is deserving of every respect. The
translation is the work of a lady, and a
very excellent and scholar-like translation
it is, clearly and pleasantly written, and
illustrated and explained by copious notes,
indicating considerable learning and research.”—<i>Saturday

genuine colour and fragrance of the East,

books to children will find this at
once instructive and delightful.”—<i>Public

simplicity of style; and if children are

genuine gratification.”—<i>Hour.</i></p>

<p>“We could have wished to give specimens
of her very just, subtle, and concise
criticisms on authors of every sort and time—poets,
moralists, historians, and philosophers.
Sara Coleridge, as she is revealed,
or rather reveals herself, in the correspondence,
makes a brilliant addition to
a brilliant family reputation.”—<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>“These charming volumes are attractive
in two ways: first, as a memorial of a most
amiable woman of high intellectual mark;
and secondly, as rekindling recollections,
and adding a little to our information regarding
the life of Sara Coleridge’s father,
the poet and philosopher.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“An acceptable record, and present an
adequate image of a mind of singular
beauty and no inconsiderable power.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

The whole book deserves the heartiest

valuable.... To the general reader the

<p><b>THE GERMAN ARTILLERY IN THE BATTLES NEAR METZ.</b>
Based on the official reports of the German Artillery. By <b>Captain
Hoffbauer</b>, Instructor in the German Artillery and Engineer School.
Translated by <b>Capt. E. O. Hollist</b>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This history gives a detailed account of
the movements of the German artillery in
the three days’ fighting to the east and
west of Metz, which resulted in paralyzing
the army under Marshal Bazaine, and its
subsequent surrender. The action of the
batteries with reference to the other arms
is clearly explained, and the valuable maps
show the positions taken up by the individual
batteries at each stage of the contests.
Tables are also supplied in the
Appendix, furnishing full details as to the
number of killed and wounded, expenditure
of ammunition, &amp;c. The campaign
of 1870-71 having demonstrated the importance
of artillery to an extent which
has not previously been conceded to it,
this work forms a valuable part of the
literature of the campaign, and will be
read with interest not only by members of
the regular but also by those of the auxiliary
forces.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Major Von Schereff’s ‘Studies in Tactics’
is worthy of the perusal—indeed, of
the thoughtful study—of every military
man. The subject of the respective advantages
of attack and defence, and of the
methods in which each form of battle

treated; indeed, we cannot but consider
it to be decidedly superior to any

<p>“Major Boguslawski’s tactical deductions
from the war are, that infantry still

that open order must henceforth be the
main principles of all drill, and that the

precision.... We must, without delay,
impress brain and forethought into the

the good work too soon, or better, than by

detail of the minor operations of the war
than any but the most observant and fortunately-placed
staff-officer is in a position
to give. I have read and re-read them
very carefully, I hope with profit, certainly
with great interest, and believe that practice,
in the sense of these ‘Studies,’ would
be a valuable preparation for manœuvres
on a more extended scale.”—Berlin, June,

<p>The Editor has undertaken to frame for
India,—what he has been eminently successful
in doing for England and her
colonies,—a series of educational works,
which he hopes will prove as suitable for
the peculiar wants of the country as they
will be consistent with the leading idea
above alluded to. Like all beginnings, his
present instalments are necessarily somewhat
meagre and elementary; but he only
awaits official and public approval to complete,
within a comparatively brief period,
his contemplated plan of a specific and
fairly comprehensive series of works in the
various leading vernaculars of the Indian
continent. Meanwhile, those on his general
catalogue may be found suitable, in their
present form, for use in the Anglo-vernacular
and English schools of India.</p>

of illustrating Scripture history—from
observation of the countries. Instead of
narrating his travels, and referring from

writes an outline history of the Hebrew
nation from Abraham downwards, with
special reference to the various points in
which the geography illustrates the history....
He is very successful in picturing
to his readers the scenes before his
own mind.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
